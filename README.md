# LINQ in Manhattan!
Want to know how many neighborhoods Manhattan has? We do, too!

## Usage
This is **not** a console application. You will have no success trying to run it as such. This application exists only in so much as it can be tested. The application takes a provided file of .json geographic data, parses that data, and returns predetermined, required parameters. Check out our rad tests and gaze in wonder (or whatever emotion you feel is appropriate given your particular context).

## License
This application is licensed under an [MIT License](https://github.com/francescodt/LINQ/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Challenge
Your solution should include the following:

[x] The data.json file to your solution root folder
[x] Read in the file and answer the questions below
[ ] Each question and answer should be outputted to the console.

### Questions
Each query builds off of the prior query. You should be chaining.

[x] Output all of the neighborhoods in this data list (Final Total: 147 neighborhoods)
[x] Filter out all the neighborhoods that do not have any names (Final Total: 143)
[x] Remove the duplicates (Final Total: 39 neighborhoods)
[x] Rewrite the queries from above and consolidate all into one single query.
[x] Rewrite at least one of these questions only using the opposing method (example: Use LINQ Query statements instead of LINQ method calls and vice versa.)

[x] You should have a total of 5 outputs.

## Installation
Simple. Install [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), open up the .sln file, and check out our test page for verification that our application does *something*.
